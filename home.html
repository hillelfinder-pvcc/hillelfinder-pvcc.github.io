                            <ul><li>
                                An impeachment is the formal process by which a Federal Officer of the United States is tried for wrongdoing. If they are found guilty of this conduct, they are removed from office by the Congress of the United States.
                            </li></ul>
                        <br /><li>What is a “Federal Officer?”</li> <!--2-->
                            <ul><li>
                                The subject of an impeachment is defined by the Federal Constitution of the United States. There, it says that a “Federal Officer” is the kind of person whose conduct can be impeachable. Unfortunately, it does not ever clarify what exact criteria constitute a Federal Officer of the United States. However, given this deficiency, Congress has impeached more than twenty people in the history of the country, including Senators, Federal Judges, and Presidents. Therefore, given this historical practice and precedents, it can be simply stated that a Federal Officer is a person who holds a high position of public office in the United States government.

                        <br /><li>What Law Allows for Impeachment?</li> <!--3-->
                            <ul>
                            <li>
                                As with many of the most important laws regarding the operation of the government, the rules of impeachment are explained in the United States Federal Constitution.
                                <ul>
                                <li>Article I, Section 2: “The House of Representatives… shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.”</li>
                                <li>Article I, Section 3: “The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.”</li>
                                <li>Article II, Section 2: “The President shall… have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”</li>
                                <li>Article II, Section 4: “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>These rules detail every state of the impeachment process, as well as some additional details about what happens to an Officer if they are convicted. Most of these points will be explained further later, but something of note is that impeachment is one of the few sentences which cannot be dispelled by the President; it is an unpardonable offense.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <br /><li>Why would Someone get Impeached?</li> <!--4-->
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    As stated in Article II, Section 4, a civil official can be impeached for treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. While the first two are very clearly criminal offenses, the phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” can include acts which are not necessarily an actual crime. Instead, it can refer to any inappropriate misconduct or abuses of power and of the people in ways which are incompatible with and erode public trust in the position of the office. This can fall into several broad categories:
                                    <ol>
                                    <li>Abusing or exceeding the powers of the office.</li>
                                    <li>Behavior which is grossly incompatible with the office.</li>
                                    <li>The use of the office for improper and/or personal gain.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Prior to its adoption by the American government, the practice of impeachment was used in 18th-Century England as a method of removing and imprisoning British public Officers engaged in ways inappropriate with their office. Much like in the English system, the United States uses impeachment as a method of “checks and balances” to ensure that Officers who are abusing their position can be removed from power.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <br /><li>What Happens if Someone is Impeached (what is the Punishment)?</li> <!--5-->
                            <ul><li>
                                In Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, it explains that if a Federal Officer is convicted (found guilty) of impeachable conduct, they are subject to removal from office, and disqualification of holding any other office of public trust in the United States. Importantly, they are not subject to any criminal penalties, such as imprisonment or fine. In this manner, the power of impeachment is very narrow, only ensuring that the Impeached is incapable of holding any position of power in the government and further abusing their office and the public trust.
                            </li></ul>
                        <br /><li>What is the Process of Impeachment?</li> <!--6-->
                            <ul><li>
                                As is outlined in Sections 2 & 3 of Article 1 of the Constitution, the United States House of Representatives and the Senate play important, but distinct roles in the impeachment process:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        The House of Representatives
                                        <ul>
                                            The House is the branch of the Federal government which begins the process of impeachment. First, they review and submit an impeachment inquiry, an investigation into a Federal Officer to find out if any of the conduct is possibly impeachable. If they decide to continue, the articles of impeachment (the charges against the official) must pass a simple majority vote in the House. If this is achieved, the Officer has been officially impeached.
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The Senate
                                        <ul>
                                            Once an Officer has been impeached, it is the job of the United States Senate to hold an impeachment trial, in which they act as Jury. Once they have adopted rules of law, considered evidence, and heard witnesses, they vote whether to convict or acquit the Officer. If more than two-thirds (67 senators) vote in favor of convicting the Officer on the articles of impeachment, then the official is removed from office, and they are barred from ever again holding a federal office. If however not enough votes to convict are acquired, then the Officer is found not guilty and may continue to maintain their position.
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li></ul>
                        <br /><li>Who has been Impeached in the Past?</li> <!--7-->
                            <ul><li>
                                Given the serious and deeply political nature of the impeachment process, there have been very few impeachments in American history, and even fewer convictions. In total, there have been 60 impeachment proceedings initiated by the House, of which only 21 impeachments made it to the Senate, and of those, only 8 Officers convicted and removed. All those found guilty, all were Federal Judges. A full list of impeachments can be found in the “Sources” tab.

                                    Of note, the Presidents impeached by the House were:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Andrew Johnson (1868)</li>
                                        <li>Richard Nixon was almost, but not impeached (1974), as he resigned from the Office of the Presidency before articles of impeachment could be brought against him</li>
                                        <li>Bill Clinton (1998)</li>
